## Introduction
Reflectica is my first Flutter application, designed to guide users in exploring a wide range of logical fallacies and books that I have read. The app boasts a clean, intuitive interface, allowing users to effortlessly navigate between sections dedicated to different logical fallacies and literature. With a focus on providing educational content, Reflectica aims to enrich the user's understanding of critical thinking and enhance their reading experience through easy-to-digest information and engaging visuals.
